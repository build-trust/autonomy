title: "Frameworks Got Us Here, but Autonomy Gets Us There"

If you’ve built an AI agent recently, you probably started with a framework like LangChain, CrewAI, or LlamaIndex. These libraries are fantastic — they made it easy to get from zero to something that runs. They gave us primitives like tools, memory, and chaining that helped turn LLM calls into working prototypes.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth: agents built this way are still just scripts.

## Scripts Don’t Ship

\
A script on your laptop can automate tasks. It can show you what’s possible. But it can’t:

- Handle real-world scale.
- Maintain state and memory across sessions. 
- Provide secure connectivity to data and APIs. 
- Run with production-grade uptime and monitoring. 
- Store results and iterate safely.

That’s the leap developers are struggling to make: from cool demo to real SaaS product or internal system.

## Frameworks Got Us Here

\
We’ve seen this pattern before.

Rails made it easy to hack together a web app locally — but the deployment story was rough until Heroku. React and Next.js unlocked front-end power — but you probably shouldn't ship them without Vercel.

Agent frameworks are in the same category. They’re important. They got us here. But they’ve quickly become commoditized. Every project has tools, chains, and memory. That’s not the hard part anymore.

The hard part is: how do you run this in production so real users can rely on it?

## Autonomy Gets Us There\
That’s why we built Autonomy.

Autonomy gives you everything you expect from an agent framework — all the features of LangChain, CrewAI, or LlamaIndex. But the real power comes when you run that code inside Autonomy Computer, a Platform-as-a-Service:

- Scale from one agent on your laptop to millions (or billions).
- Connect securely to APIs, databases, and other agents. 
- Memory and storage built into the runtime, not bolted on. 
- Deploy once and let the platform handle reliability, uptime, and iteration.

_In short: Autonomy is not just a framework. It’s the environment where agents become products._

## Why Developers Care

\
If you’re experimenting, frameworks alone are fine. But if you want to ship:

- Don’t duct-tape infra around a fragile script.
- Don’t reinvent auth, state, and networking. 
- Don’t burn cycles building the “boring” platform pieces that someone else has already solved.

Use the Autonomy SDK, and your agent code is automatically wired into a runtime that handles all of this for you. Just like Heroku was the “right way” to deploy Rails apps, and Vercel is the “right way” to deploy front-ends — Autonomy is the right way to ship agents.

👉 Developers: keep building with the tools you love. But when you’re ready to go from prototype to production, there’s only one place to run it. autonomy.computer
