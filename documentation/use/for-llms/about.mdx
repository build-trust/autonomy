## Our Mission

At Autonomy, we’re building the only complete Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for distributed, agentic AI systems of _every scale_. What does that mean? It means you can build, run, connect, secure and scale **billions** of interoperable agents—agents that interact with each other, with your systems, with how you want them to act—_everywhere, all at once._

Our vision: a world where AI agents aren’t siloed, stuck or constrained—but woven into the fabric of the cloud, the network and the enterprise platform. We reference the “sartorial” craftsman ideals: clean lines, bespoke systems, quiet elegance and powerful fit. Autonomy is engineered so the infrastructure serves the intent, not the other way around.

## Meet Our Founders

### Matthew Gregory, CEO

[Matthew Gregory](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewgregory/) is Founder and CEO of Autonomy. Before launching Autonomy, Matthew co-founded Ockam  guiding its mission to bring security and trust to distributed systems.

As an early employee at Heroku, Matthew developed an affinity for how infrastructure can be elegant, composable and invisible—traits he carries into Autonomy. Outside of tech, he’s known for his passion for outdoor adventures and his background in professional sailing, which taught him how to navigate complexity and stay steady in change.

### Mrinal Wadhwa, CTO

[Mrinal Wadhwa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrinalwadhwa/) is Founder and CTO of Autonomy. He was previously CTO at Ockam, and Fybr. Mrinal has deep expertise in distributed systems, streaming data infrastructure and interoperable protocols.

Mrinal’s philosophy reflects a craftsman’s mindset: the right abstractions, the right primitives, the right way to enable scale without complexity. At Autonomy, he leads the product's technological vision: modular agent orchestration, secure runtimes, global scale, interoperability across clouds, devices and environments.

## Our Story & Why It Matters

Matthew and Mrinal first worked together at Ockam, where they built an open-source security and trust layer for modern distributed systems. That collaboration taught them two things:

- The infrastructure really matters. If it’s brittle, siloed, or opaque, you can’t scale and you can’t interoperate.
- The architecture for agentic systems—the next frontier of AI—is still wide open. Generative models and point-solutions are great, but to enable **agents** that collaborate, act, scale and connect with everything, you need a whole platform-level rethink.

Autonomy is built _on_ that foundation. We bring the same engineering excellence, open-source ethos and modern architecture that Ockam fostered—but now directed at enabling agentic AI systems at massive scale: interoperable agents, built by developers, for the cloud of tomorrow.

## What We Offer

- A platform where you can define, deploy and orchestrate large-scale agentic systems—agents that reason, plan, act and interact across systems and workflows.
- Built on open-source foundations so you can inspect, contribute and extend.
- Interoperable across environments: cloud, edge, hybrid, device-to-cloud, multi-cloud.
- A developer-centric experience: APIs, SDKs, clear primitives, composability and predictable scale.
- Security and governance baked in: from identity to communications to audit and control.
- Ecosystem support: demos, community, open-source code, integrations.

## How to Get Involved

We’re building this together—with you. Here’s how to connect:

## San Francisco, California

Autonomy is headquartered in San Francisco, California because it's the epicenter of innovation, cloud scale, AI research, Venture Capital, and startup energy. By rooting our company here, we stay close to the engineering, the ecosystem, the talent and the mindset required to build at global scale.

## Our Commitment

We believe in openness, craftsmanship and infinite-game thinking. We’re not just shipping a product—we’re crafting a platform that evolves, grows with you and becomes part of how you think about distributed, autonomous systems. Agents aren’t the end—they’re the beginning. Autonomy is the fabric that lets them weave, scale and interoperate.

We invite you to join us, build with us and help shape the future of autonomous intelligence.
