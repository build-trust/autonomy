# New Autonomy application or project

To run this Autonomy app:

### Step 1

[Sign up](https://my.autonomy.computer) for an account with Autonomy to create your new Cluster.

### Step 2

Install `autonomy` command by running the following in your terminal.
```bash
curl -sSfL autonomy.computer/install | bash && . "$HOME/.autonomy/env"
```

### Step 3

Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running on your workstation before running the `autonomy` command.

You can check that docker is working correctly by running:

```
docker ps
```

### Step 4

Enroll your workstation with Autonomy

```
autonomy cluster enroll --no-input
```

### Step 5

If you haven't already, get the code for this app by running:

```
autonomy zone init build-trust/autonomy-zone-hello
```

This will generate the following files:

```

├── autonomy.yaml
└── images
    └── main
        ├── Dockerfile
        ├── index.html
        └── main.py
```


### Step 6

Deploy the zone defined in this app as follows:

```
autonomy zone deploy
```

This will display the name of your zone and your cluster.
Take note of those values, you will need them later.

The `autonomy.yaml` file sets `public: true` on the main pod of your app. That
will give your app a public api endpoint and cause the interactive web UI defined in
`images/main/index.html` to be served from `https://${CLUSTER}-${ZONE}.cluster.autonomy.computer/`

Try it: https://${CLUSTER}-$ZONE}.cluster.autonomy.computer/

### Step 7

Check that the agent defined in `images/main/main.py` is responding to an api call:

```
curl --request POST \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"message":"who are you?"}' \
"https://${CLUSTER}-$ZONE}.cluster.autonomy.computer/agents/henry"
```

### Step 8

You can optionally start a portal / create a private link to the logs of
the deployed app by running

```
autonomy zone inlet --to logs
```

This is a blocking command that will expose the logs of your app
on `http://127.0.0.1:32101` if port `32101` is free, or it will pick another
random free port.

Once this is running, you can privately see streaming logs of your app
by visitng `http://127.0.0.1:32101`
