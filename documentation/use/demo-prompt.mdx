Create a new autonomy app that news editors can use for fact checking news stories.

The workflow is:
- The editor pastes an article into a text box
- An agent then breaks the article into a set of claims
- Each claim is then assigned to a parallel fact checking agent
- Fact checking agents research the claim on the internet using the brave search MCP server
- All the research is given to a report generating agent that creates a final fact check report.

Also create a very simple web UI for the app using nextjs and shadcn/ui

Deploy and test the app in Autonomy

Before creating and deploying the app, create a README with an architecture diagram of the app.
