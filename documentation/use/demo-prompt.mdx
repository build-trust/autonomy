Use curl to fetch and read this doc and included links
on creating a new autonomy application:
https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents.md

Use the above documentation to create a new Autonomy that news editors
can use for fact checking news stories.

The workflow is:
- The editor pastes an article into a text box
- An agent then breaks the article into a set of claims
- Each claim is then assigned to a parallel fact checking agent
- Fact checking agents research the claim on the internet using
  the brave search MCP server
- All the research is given to a report generating agent that creates
  a final fact check report.

Keep the app limited to one autonomy node.
Also create a very simple web UI for the app using nextjs and shadcn/ui

Deploy and test the app in Autonomy

Before creating and deploying the app, create a README with an
architecture diagram of the app.
