Fetch https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents.md
and relavant included links for docs on creating Autonomy apps.

Create an Autonomy app for fact-checking news articles, with this workflow:
1. A news editor pastes an article
2. An extractor agent extracts claims from that article
3. Parallel fact checking agents fact-check each claim using the Brave Search MCP
4. A report generator agent creates a report on the findings

Build a Next.js + shadcn/ui interface.

Create a README with an architecture diagram. Then deploy and test in Autonomy.
```
