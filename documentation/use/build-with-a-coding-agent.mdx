---

Coding agents like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Cline, Devin, and Zed can
use Autonomy documentation to ship complete autonomous applications.

1. Follow the initial instructions to [Get Started with Autonomy](/start/get-started).
2. Set up your favorite coding agent and give it the following prompt.

---

```
Use curl to fetch and read this doc and included links
on creating a new Autonomy application:
https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents.md

Use the above documentation to create a new Autonomy app that news editors
can use for fact-checking news stories.

The workflow is:
- The editor pastes an article into a text box.
- An agent then breaks the article into a set of claims.
- Each claim is then assigned to a parallel fact-checking agent.
- Fact-checking agents research the claim on the internet using
  the Brave Search MCP server.
- All the research is given to a report-generating agent that creates
  a final fact-check report.

Keep the app limited to one Autonomy node.
Also create a very simple web UI for the app using Next.js and shadcn/ui.

Deploy and test the app in Autonomy.

Before creating and deploying the app, create a README with an
architecture diagram of the app.
```
---

Your coding agent will:

- Refer to the Autonomy documentation to learn how to create, deploy, and debug Autonomy apps.
- Create a README describing the architecture of the application.
- Write Python code for claim extraction, fact-checking, and reporter agents.
- Write code to create parallel fact-checking deep-research agents.
- Set up the Brave Search MCP server and create streaming APIs.
- Build a Next.js user interface.
- Deploy the application to the Autonomy Computer and test it.
