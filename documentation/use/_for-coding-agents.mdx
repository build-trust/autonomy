## Common Autonomy Commands

Essential commands for managing your cluster and zones:

```bash
# Install the autonomy command
curl -sSfL autonomy.computer/install | bash && . "$HOME/.autonomy/env"

# Check if already enrolled and has a cluster
autonomy cluster show                 # Show cluster info, if enrolled

# If not enrolled, enroll and get a cluster
autonomy cluster enroll --no-input

# Manage Zones
autonomy zone list                    # List all zones in your cluster
autonomy zone deploy                  # Deploy/update your zone
autonomy zone delete --yes            # Delete your zone

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Monitor and debug - start logs server in background
autonomy zone inlet --to logs > logs_server.log 2>&1 &
LOGS_PID=$!

# Get the port and stream logs in terminal
sleep 3
LOGS_PORT=$(grep -o "localhost:[0-9]*" logs_server.log | cut -d: -f2 | head -1)
POD_NAME=main-pod
CONTAINER_NAME=main
FULL_POD_NAME=$(timeout 10s curl -s "127.0.0.1:$LOGS_PORT/" | grep -o 'main-pod-[a-z0-9]*-[a-z0-9]*' | head -1)
timeout 30s curl -N "127.0.0.1:$LOGS_PORT/pods/$FULL_POD_NAME/containers/$CONTAINER_NAME" | head -50

# Or view logs in browser
open "http://127.0.0.1:$LOGS_PORT"

# Stop logs server when done
kill $LOGS_PID
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Patterns for using curl to test and debug

```bash
# To test APIs - always include timeout
timeout 15s curl --silent --request POST \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"message":"What are the key elements of a contract?"}' \
"https://a9eb812238f753132652ae09963a05e9-hello.cluster.autonomy.computer/agents/henry?stream=true"

# To stream logs - always use timeout, -N, and head
timeout 30s curl -N "127.0.0.1:32101/pods/main-pod-567479494f-6w9xq/containers/main" | head -50
```

### 📁 Important File Templates

When creating new files always refer the following file templates and the [guide on creating and deploying a new Autonomy app](https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents/create-a-new-autonomy-app.mdx)

**autonomy.yaml** (Lines 70-80):

```yaml
name: hello # Must be ≤10 characters
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    public: true
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
```

**images/main/Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/build-trust/autonomy-python
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "main.py"]
```

**images/main/main.py**:

```python
from autonomy import Agent, Model, Node

async def main(node):
    await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        name="henry",
        instructions="You are Henry, an expert legal assistant",
        model=Model("claude-sonnet-4-v1")
    )

Node.start(main)
```


## 📖 Definitions

### Autonomy
Autonomy is a platform to ship autonomous AI products.

It provides:

1. **Autonomy Framework**: The Autonomy Framework is an open-source python framework to develop apps and products that leverage teams of collaborating AI agents to autonomously accomplish goals.
2. **Autonomy Computer**: The Autonomy Computer is a cloud-based runtime to run, connect, and scale apps built using the Autonomy Framework. It provides managed infrastructure to run highly scalable and secure autonomous products.
3. **Autonomy Command**: The Autonomy Command is a command-line program to build apps using the Autonomy Framework and run them on the Autonomy Computer.

### Agents

Agents are intelligent actors that autonomously accomplish goals. Apps, running on the Autonomy Computer, can create millions of parallel collaborating agents in seconds.

Each agent:
- Has a unique identity.
- Uses a large language model to understand, reason, and make autonomous decisions.
- Has memory, so it can retain and recall information over time, to make better autonomous decisions.
- Invokes tools to gather new information and take actions.
- Makes plans that break down complex tasks into small iterative steps.
- Can retrieve knowledge beyond the training data of its language model.
- Collaborates with and can delegate work to other agents.

Autonomy Agents are built using the actor model and have all the properties of actors.

### Models
Agents use large language models to understand, reason, and make autonomous decisions. Apps running on the Autonomy Computer can use a wide variety of managed models.

### Memory
Agents have memory organized by scope ID and conversation ID so they can retain and recall information over time to make better autonomous decisions.

### Tools
Tools are external functions that agents can invoke to take actions and gather more information. These external functions can be written in Python or provided by MCP servers.

## Best Practices

* When creating new files always refer the [guide on creating and deploying a new Autonomy app](https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents/create-a-new-autonomy-app.mdx) to find the right initial file template.
* Always reference the complete Autonomy guide before starting any Autonomy-related development.
* Prefer simple and minimal approaches where possible.
* When you're asked to create an example, create a simplest case first and then offer to improve it.
* Zone names must be ≤10 characters.
* Memory is conversation-local, not global.
* Generate a README.md in new apps that you create. Include ascii architecture diagrams in this README.md file

**Remember:** We designed this reference specifically for coding agents. Always refer the complete context from these specialized guides rather than trying to recreate patterns from memory. This approach ensures consistency and prevents common deployment issues.
