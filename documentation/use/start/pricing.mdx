## Free trial

When you sign up, we give you \$50 of credit to use over your first 14 days. This is more than enough for you to kick the tires and experience the magic of Autonomy.

## Base bundle

\$75 per month, includes:

- 1 Seat licence.
- 744 `Regular` compute container hours.
- 100 GBs of data transfer.
- 1 GB of storage.

## Ala cart items

We only charge you for your consumption of the underlying infrastructure cost that you incur. These charges include the additional compute, network, storage, LLM inference services that your product or application utilizes beyond the [Base bundle](#base-bundle).

- **Compute:**
  - **Regular:** \$25 per month per containter. Each has the capacity to run _thousands_ of concurrent agents, tools, or an MCP server. Measured per minute, rounded up to the nearest minute.
  - **Big:** \$250 per month per container - When you need to run _millions_ of concurrent agents, tools, or an MCP server, add a `Big` containter to run agents with absurd cost efficiency.
- **Network:**
  - Public Endpoints: \$0.10 / GB
  - Private Links: \$10 per service per month, plus \$0.10 / GB
- **Storage:**
  - \$1 / GB / month
- **Seat Licenses:**
  - \$25 per person / month

## Use Autonomy with care. It’s powerful!

**Your account has no upper bound usage limit**. You have unlimited ability to scale the
agents you deplo and the amount of data they transfer/store. You can connect to a vast array
of inference models. Some of these inference models cost 1000x more than others.
You could spend \$5 or \$5000 in a very short period of time - just by changing the models you use.

If you want to control your costs, here are some parameters to start with:

- Use `Regular` size containers, which is the default value.
- Use inexpensive LLMs like amazon nova-micro-v1, nova-lite-v1 etc.
- Use `autonomy zone list` to see all running zones.
- Use `autonomy zone delete` to delete a zone that you are not using anymore.
