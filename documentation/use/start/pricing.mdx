## Free trial

We will give you \$50 of credit to use over your first 14 days. This should be more than enough for you to kick the tires and experience the magic of Autonomy.

## Base Bundle

\$75 per month, includes

- 1 Seat licence
- 720`Regular`compute container hours
- 100 GBs of data transfer
- 1 GB of Storage
- _Note:_ All LLM useage is ala cart - see the table below.

## **Ala cart items**

We will only charge you for your consumption of the underlying infrastructure cost that you incur. These charges include the additional compute, network, storage, LLM inference services that your product or application utilizes beyond the **Base Bundle**.

- **Compute:**
  - `Regular`**:** \$25 per month per containter - Each has the capacity to run _thousands_ of concurrent agents, tools, or an MCP server. Measured per minute, rounded up to the nearest minute.
  - `Big`**:** \$250 per month per container - When you need to run _millions_ of concurrent agents, tools, or an MCP server, add a`Big`containter to run agents with absurd cost efficiency.
- **Network:**
  - Public Endpoints
    - \$0.10 / GB
  - Private Links
    - \$10 per service per month, plus \$0.10 / GB
- **Storage:**
  - \$1 / GB / month
- **Seat Licenses:**
  - \$25pp / month
- **LLM Models:**

## Use Autonomy with care. It’s powerful!

\
**Your account has no upper bound usage limit**. You have been granted the unlimited ability to scale the number of agents you deploy, the amount of data they transfer, and the amount of memory / knowledge they store. You can connect to a vast array of LLM inference models. Some of these inference models cost 1000x more than others. You could spend \$5 or \$5000 in a very short period of time - just by changing the inference models you use.

If you want to control your costs, here are some parameters to start with:

- Use `Regular` size containers, which is the default value.
- Use inexpensive LLMs like llama3.2 (the default model), amazon nova-micro-v1, nova-lite-v1 etc.
- During development and experimentation, create zones using `autonomy --rm`. This command will automatically delete the zone as soon as you **Ctrl+C** out of your session.
- Use `autonomy zone list` to see all running zones and `autonomy zone delete` to delete a zone that you are not using anymore.
