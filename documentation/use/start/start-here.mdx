Autonomy provides developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, deploy, and scale products that autonomously accomplish goals.

### Autonomy Framework

The Autonomy Framework is an **open-source python framework** to develop apps that use thousands of collaborating **autonomous agents** to quickly and reliably get things done.

Your apps can **curate context** and create **deep work agents** that excel at long and complex tasks. Each agent can access a **dedicated filesystem** to plan and take **notes**.

Agents can delegate work to other agents and create many **sub-agents** that concentrate on sub-tasks. **Parallel agents**, each focused on a small part, achieve the overall goal faster. They are also more successful because the context they provide their language model contains much less noise.

### Autonomy Computer

The Autonomy Computer is a **cloud-based runtime** to deploy, connect, and scale apps built using the Autonomy Framework. It provides all the infrastructure that you need to run highly scalable and secure autonomous AI products.

Using a simple yaml config, you can spin up a **dedicated cluster of nodes** in seconds. These nodes are automatically connected together using high throughput, mutually authenticated, and encrypted **messaging channels**.

Agents invoke tools to take actions and gather data. The Autonomy Computer can **provision tools** in containers right alongside the nodes that are running your agents. These tools can be python functions, simple binaries, or MCP servers. You can also create **private links to enterprise data**.

The runtime is designed for **multi-tenant**, **streaming** workloads. Agents run as **stateful concurrent actors** that asynchronously send and receive messages. This enables effortless horizontal scaling and fan-out through powerful patterns like **distributed agentic map-reduce.**
