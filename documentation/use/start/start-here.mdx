Autonomy provides tools for developers and cloud infrastructure to build, deploy, and scale AI products that autonomously accomplish goals.

<Card title="Autonomy Framework">
  

  The Autonomy Framework is an open-source python framework to develop products that use thousands of collaborating **autonomous agents** to quickly and reliably get things done.

  Your apps can **curate context** and create **deep work agents** that succeed on long and complex tasks. Each agent can access a **dedicated filesystem** to plan and take **notes**.

  Agents can delegate work to other agents and create many **sub-agents** that focus on smaller tasks. **Parallel agents** that concentrate on small objectives are more successful and can together acheive their bigger goal faster.
</Card>

<Card title="Autonomy Computer">
  

  The Autonomy Computer is a **cloud-based runtime** to run, connect, and scale apps built using the Autonomy Framework. It provides managed infrastructure to deploy highly scalable and secure autonomous products.

## Concepts

### Agents

Agents are intelligent actors. They use large language models to understand context, reason through problems, and make autonomous decisions. They gather information and take actions by invoking tools.

- They can plan and take multiple steps.
- They remember.
- They can call tools to:
  - Take actions.
  - Sense their environment.
  - Retrieve data. 

Agents are intelligent actors that autonomously accomplish goals. Apps, running on the Autonomy Computer, can create millions of parallel collaborating agents in seconds.Each agent:

- Has a unique identity.
- Uses a large language model to understand, reason, and make autonomous decisions.
- Has memory, so it can retain and recall information over time, to make better autonomous decisions.
- Invokes tools to gather new information and take actions.
- Makes plans that break down complex tasks into small iterative steps.
- Can retrieve knowledge beyond the training data of its language model.
- Collaborates with and can delegate work to other agents.

Autonomy Agents are built using the actor model and have all the properties of actors.

. Apps, running on the Autonomy Computer, can create millions of parallel collaborating agents in seconds.

Intelligent actors that autonomously accomplish goals using large language models, memory, tools, and planning. Each agent has a unique identity, isolated state, and can collaborate with other agents. Built on the actor model, agents can be created in seconds and scaled to millions of parallel instances across the Autonomy Computer.

### Models

Large language models that agents use for understanding, reasoning, and making autonomous decisions. Autonomy Computer provides access to multiple managed models including Claude, Llama, DeepSeek, and AWS Bedrock, allowing you to choose the right model for each agent's task.

[Learn more about Models →](/agents/models)

### Tools

External functions that agents invoke to gather information and take actions. Tools can be Python functions you write, MCP servers for external service integration, or built-in tools like time utilities, asking users for input, and delegating to subagents. Agents autonomously decide when to use tools based on their reasoning.

### Context

The system for organizing what gets sent to the model on each interaction. Context uses templates and sections to dynamically build model input, including system instructions, conversation history, and custom data sources like knowledge bases or real-time information. This gives you fine-grained control over what your agents know and remember.

### Memory

How agents persist information across interactions. Conversation memory automatically maintains chat history organized by scope and conversation ID, enabling multi-turn dialogues and user isolation. For persistent storage of documents, knowledge bases, and state that survives across conversations, filesystem-based storage using FilesystemTools is recommended.

### Workers

Message-processing components that run inside Nodes, following the actor model. Workers can maintain internal state, process messages sequentially, and run either locally or distributed across multiple machines for parallel processing at scale. They're perfect for CPU-intensive tasks and background processing.

## Architecture Overview

Autonomy Computer uses a hierarchical architecture to organize and scale your applications:

```
Cluster (your dedicated cloud environment)
└── Zones (your applications)
    └── Pods (containers running together)
        └── Containers (Docker containers)
            └── Node (Autonomy runtime)
                ├── Agents (intelligent actors)
                └── Workers (message processors)
```

**Cluster** - Your dedicated cloud infrastructure with a unique ID **Zone** - A single deployed application defined by `autonomy.yaml` **Pod** - A logical group of containers running on the same machine **Container** - Docker containers running your code or services **Node** - The Autonomy runtime where agents and workers execute

## Prerequisites

Before you start building with Autonomy, make sure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account">
    [Sign up](https://my.autonomy.computer) for an account with Autonomy to get your dedicated Cluster in the cloud.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Docker">
    Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed and running on your workstation. Verify by running `docker ps` in your terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Terminal Access">
    You'll need terminal access to run the `autonomy` command and deploy your applications.
  </Step>
</Steps>
