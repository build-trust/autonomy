## What is Autonomy?

Autonomy is a platform to ship autonomous AI products. It provides everything you need to build, deploy, and scale applications powered by intelligent AI agents.

Autonomy consists of three parts:

**Autonomy Framework** - An open-source Python framework for developing applications that leverage teams of collaborating AI agents to autonomously accomplish goals.

**Autonomy Computer** - A cloud-based runtime that runs, connects, and scales apps built with the Autonomy Framework. It provides managed infrastructure for highly scalable and secure autonomous products.

**Autonomy Command** - A command-line tool to build apps using the Autonomy Framework and deploy them to the Autonomy Computer.

## Core Concepts

### Agents

Intelligent actors that autonomously accomplish goals using large language models, memory, tools, and planning. Each agent has a unique identity, isolated state, and can collaborate with other agents. Built on the actor model, agents can be created in seconds and scaled to millions of parallel instances across the Autonomy Computer.

### Models

Large language models that agents use for understanding, reasoning, and making autonomous decisions. Autonomy Computer provides access to multiple managed models including Claude, Llama, DeepSeek, and AWS Bedrock, allowing you to choose the right model for each agent's task.

### Tools

External functions that agents invoke to gather information and take actions. Tools can be Python functions you write, MCP servers for external service integration, or built-in tools like time utilities, asking users for input, and delegating to subagents. Agents autonomously decide when to use tools based on their reasoning.

### Context

The system for organizing what gets sent to the model on each interaction. Context uses templates and sections to dynamically build model input, including system instructions, conversation history, and custom data sources like knowledge bases or real-time information. This gives you fine-grained control over what your agents know and remember.

### Memory

How agents persist information across interactions. Conversation memory automatically maintains chat history organized by scope and conversation ID, enabling multi-turn dialogues and user isolation. For persistent storage of documents, knowledge bases, and state that survives across conversations, filesystem-based storage using FilesystemTools is recommended.

### Workers

Message-processing components that run inside Nodes, following the actor model. Workers can maintain internal state, process messages sequentially, and run either locally or distributed across multiple machines for parallel processing at scale. They're perfect for CPU-intensive tasks and background processing.

## Architecture Overview

Autonomy Computer uses a hierarchical architecture to organize and scale your applications:

```
Cluster (your dedicated cloud environment)
└── Zones (your applications)
    └── Pods (containers running together)
        └── Containers (Docker containers)
            └── Node (Autonomy runtime)
                ├── Agents (intelligent actors)
                └── Workers (message processors)
```

**Cluster** - Your dedicated cloud infrastructure with a unique ID
**Zone** - A single deployed application defined by `autonomy.yaml`
**Pod** - A logical group of containers running on the same machine
**Container** - Docker containers running your code or services
**Node** - The Autonomy runtime where agents and workers execute

## Prerequisites

Before you start building with Autonomy, make sure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account">
    [Sign up](https://my.autonomy.computer) for an account with Autonomy to get your dedicated Cluster in the cloud.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Docker">
    Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed and running on your workstation. Verify by running `docker ps` in your terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Terminal Access">
    You'll need terminal access to run the `autonomy` command and deploy your applications.
  </Step>
</Steps>
