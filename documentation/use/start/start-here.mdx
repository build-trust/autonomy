Autonomy is a foundation to build and scale products that use teams of **deep work agents** to autonomously perform long and complex tasks. Each agent can plan, take notes on a filesystem, **curate context** on every turn, and delegate work to **parallel sub-agents**.

### Autonomy Framework

The Autonomy Framework is an **open-source Python framework** to develop apps that use thousands of collaborating **autonomous agents** to quickly and reliably get things done.

Your apps can easily create **deep work agents** that excel at long and complex tasks. Each agent can access a **dedicated filesystem** to save plans, take **notes**, and record memories.

Agents can create many **sub-agents** that concentrate on sub-tasks. **Parallel agents**, each focused on a small part, achieve the overall goal faster. They are also more successful because the context that they provide to their language model contains much less noise.

### Autonomy Computer

The Autonomy Computer is a **cloud-based runtime** to deploy, connect, and scale apps built using the Autonomy Framework. It provides infrastructure to run highly scalable and secure autonomous AI products.

Using a simple YAML config, you can spin up a **dedicated cluster of nodes** in seconds. These nodes are automatically connected together using high-throughput, encrypted **messaging channels**.

Agents invoke tools to take actions and gather data. The Autonomy Computer can **provision tools** in containers right alongside the nodes that are running your agents. These tools can be Python functions, simple binaries, or MCP servers. You can also create **private links to enterprise data**.

The runtime is designed for **multi-tenant**, **streaming** workloads. Agents run as **stateful concurrent actors** that asynchronously send and receive messages. This enables effortless horizontal scaling and fan-out through powerful patterns like **distributed agentic map-reduce.**

### Autonomy Command

The Autonomy Command is a command-line tool to build apps using the Autonomy Framework and deploy them to the Autonomy Computer.

## Get Started

Follow these steps to set up Autonomy and deploy your first autonomous app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account">
    [Sign up](https://my.autonomy.computer) for an account with Autonomy to create your new cluster.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up Docker">
    Check that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed and running on your workstation. You can confirm that Docker is correctly set up by running `docker ps` in your terminal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Autonomy command">
    Install the `autonomy` command by running the following in your terminal:

    ```bash
    curl -sSfL autonomy.computer/install | bash && . "$HOME/.autonomy/env"
    ```
    
    It will download the right binary and make it available in your terminal.
