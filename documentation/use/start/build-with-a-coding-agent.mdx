Use a coding agent to build and deploy an example app for news editors.

An orchestrator agent breaks an article down into claims. Each claim is assigned to a parallel deep research agent that researches that claim on the Internet. A reporting agent produces a final report based on the research.

The app is built and deployed to Autonomy without typing any code.

It gets a public URL, a streaming API, and a nice user interface. The required infra, models, memory, and MCP servers are automagically provisioned. In 10 minutes, we have a bootstrapped codebase and a deployed multi-agent product to share with customers.

Open your favorite coding agent and give it the following prompt:

```
Use curl to fetch and read this doc and included links
on creating a new autonomy application:
https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents.md

Use the above documentation to create a new Autonomy that news editors
can use for fact checking news stories.

The workflow is:
- The editor pastes an article into a text box
- An agent then breaks the article into a set of claims
- Each claim is then assigned to a parallel fact checking agent
- Fact checking agents research the claim on the internet using
  the brave search MCP server
- All the research is given to a report generating agent that creates
  a final fact check report.

Also create a very simple web UI for the app using nextjs and shadcn/ui

Deploy and test the app in Autonomy

Before creating and deploying the app, create a README with an
architecture diagram of the app.
```

Your coding agent will:

- Refer the Autonomy documentation to learn how to create, deploy, and debug Autonomy apps
- Create a README describing the architecture of the application
- Write Python code for claim extraction, fact-checking, and reporter agents
- Write code to create parallel fact-checking deep research agents
- Set up the Brave Search MCP server and create streaming APIs
- Build a Next.js user interface
- Deploy the application to the Autonomy Computer and test it.
