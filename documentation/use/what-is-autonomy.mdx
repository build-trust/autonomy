Autonomy is a foundation to build and scale products that use teams of
**deep work agents** to autonomously perform long and complex tasks. Each agent
can plan, take notes on a filesystem, **curate context** on every turn, and
delegate work to **parallel sub-agents**.

### Autonomy Framework

The Autonomy Framework is an **open-source python framework** to develop
apps that use thousands of collaborating **autonomous agents** to quickly and
reliably get things done.

Your apps can easily create **deep work agents** that excel at long and
complex tasks. Each agent can access a **dedicated filesystem** to save plans,
take **notes**, and record memories.

Agents can create many **sub-agents** that concentrate on sub-tasks.
**Parallel agents**, each focused on a small part, achieve the overall goal faster.
They are also more successful because the context that they provide to their
language model contains much less noise.

### Autonomy Computer

The Autonomy Computer is a **cloud-based runtime** to deploy, connect, and scale
apps built using the Autonomy Framework. It provides infrastructure to run highly
scalable and secure autonomous AI products.

Using a simple YAML config, you can spin up a **dedicated cluster of nodes** in
seconds. These nodes are automatically connected together using high-throughput,
encrypted **messaging channels**.

Agents invoke tools to take actions and gather data. The Autonomy Computer
can **provision tools** in containers right alongside the nodes that are running
your agents. These tools can be Python functions, simple binaries, or MCP servers.
You can also create **private links to enterprise data**.

The runtime is designed for **multi-tenant**, **streaming** workloads. Agents
run as **stateful concurrent actors** that asynchronously send and receive messages.
This enables effortless horizontal scaling and fan-out through powerful patterns
like **distributed agentic map-reduce.**

### Autonomy Command

The Autonomy Command is a command-line tool to build apps using the
Autonomy Framework and deploy them to the Autonomy Computer. It packages source
code into container images and runs them in your cluster.
