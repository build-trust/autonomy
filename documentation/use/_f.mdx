# A reference for coding agents and assitants to build and deploy Autonomy apps

## 🎯 Quick Navigation by Topic

The following guide provides complete implementation details, code templates, and best practices:

### 🚀 Get Started

[**→ "Coding Agents: How to create and deploy a new Autonomy app"**](https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents/create-a-new-autonomy-app) _Keywords: setup, hello world, installation, first app, deployment, autonomy.yaml, docker_

- Create an initial minimal setup and file structure
- Create an agent and a simple streaming chat interface for this agent
- Deploy from localhost to production in minutes
- See logs of deployed apps

## 🚨 Critical Information for Coding Agents

### ⚠️ Essential Safety Rules

**Zone Requirements:**

- Zone names **MUST** be 10 characters or less
- Use descriptive but short names

**File Structure:**

- Follow exact templates for reliability
- Don't define `@app.get("/")` if using automatic `index.html` serving

**curl Command Safety:**

- **ALWAYS** use `timeout Xs` prefix (10-30 seconds typical)
- **NEVER** use bare curl commands that can hang indefinitely
- For streaming: combine timeout + `| head -N` to limit output

### 🔧 Quick Setup Checklist

1. **Create project directory** with zone name ≤ 10 characters
2. **`Create autonomy.yaml`** with basic pod configuration
3. **`Create images/main/Dockerfile`** using autonomy-python base
4. **`Create images/main/main.py`** with Agent.start() pattern
5. **`Optional: Create images/main/index.html`** for web interface
6. **`Deploy with autonomy zone deploy`**

## 📖 Essential Templates

### Basic autonomy.yaml

```yaml
name: hello
pods:
  - name: main-pod
    public: true
    containers:
      - name: main
        image: main
```

### Basic main.py

```python
from autonomy import Agent, Model, Node

async def main(node):
    await Agent.start(
        node=node,
        name="assistant",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
        model=Model("claude-sonnet-4-v1")
    )

Node.start(main)
```

### Basic Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/build-trust/autonomy-python
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "main.py"]
```

## 🌐 Safe curl Command Patterns

**✅ ALWAYS use these patterns:**

```bash
# For API calls
timeout 15s curl --silent --request POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{}' "endpoint"

# For streaming endpoints
timeout 30s curl -N "endpoint" | head -50

# For data fetching
timeout 10s curl -s "endpoint" | grep pattern | head -1
```

**❌ NEVER use these patterns:**

```bash
curl -s ... | tail -n 10    # Can hang indefinitely
curl ... | head -20         # No timeout protection
curl -N "endpoint"           # Streaming without limits
```

## 🔍 Finding Information

Each guide is designed to be self-contained while cross-referencing related topics. Use the keywords listed under each guide to quickly find relevant information.

**For specific topics, find solutions in these guides:**

- **Setup issues**: Check Getting Started Guide
- **Model performance**: Review Models Guide
- **API patterns**: Use Custom APIs Guide
- **Security**: Apply Configuration Guide + Best Practices Guide
- **Frontend**: Build with UI Development Guide
- **State management**: Manage with Memory Guide
- **External services**: Integrate with Tools Guide
- **Deployment problems**: Debug with Commands Reference Guide

## ⚡ Key Reminders for Agents

1. **Reference complete guides** rather than recreate patterns from memory
2. **Use exact file structures** and code templates from the guides
3. **Test incrementally** - start simple, then add complexity
4. **Follow safe patterns** especially for curl commands
5. **Check prerequisites** before you proceed with complex setups
6. **Verify zone names** stay 10 characters or less
7. **Add timeouts** to all external calls and curl commands

## 📖 Definitions

### Autonomy

Autonomy is a platform to ship autonomous AI products.

It provides:

1. **Autonomy Framework**: The Autonomy Framework is an open-source python framework to develop apps and products that leverage teams of collaborating AI agents to autonomously accomplish goals.
2. **Autonomy Computer**: The Autonomy Computer is a cloud-based runtime to run, connect, and scale apps built using the Autonomy Framework. It provides managed infrastructure to run highly scalable and secure autonomous products.
3. **Autonomy Command**: The Autonomy Command is a command-line program to build apps using the Autonomy Framework and run them on the Autonomy Computer.

### Agents

Agents are intelligent actors that autonomously accomplish goals. Apps, running on the Autonomy Computer, can create millions of parallel collaborating agents in seconds.

Each agent:

- Has a unique identity.
- Uses a large language model to understand, reason, and make autonomous decisions.
- Has memory, so it can retain and recall information over time, to make better autonomous decisions.
- Invokes tools to gather new information and take actions.
- Makes plans that break down complex tasks into small iterative steps.
- Can retrieve knowledge beyond the training data of its language model.
- Collaborates with and can delegate work to other agents.

Autonomy Agents are built using the actor model and have all the properties of actors.

### Models

Agents use large language models to understand, reason, and make autonomous decisions. Apps running on the Autonomy Computer can use a wide variety of managed models.

### Memory

Agents have memory organized by scope ID and conversation ID so they can retain and recall information over time to make better autonomous decisions.

### Tools

Tools are external functions that agents can invoke to take actions and gather more information. These external functions can be written in Python or provided by MCP servers.

**Remember:** We designed this guide specifically for coding agents. Always reference the complete context from these specialized guides rather than trying to recreate patterns from memory. This approach ensures consistency and prevents common deployment issues.
