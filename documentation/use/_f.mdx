# A reference for coding agents and assitants to build and deploy Autonomy apps

## 🎯 Quick Navigation by Topic

The following topic specific guides provides complete implementation details,
code templates, and best practices:

### 🚀 [How to create and deploy a new Autonomy app](https://autonomy.computer/docs/_for-coding-agents/create-a-new-autonomy-app.md)
*Keywords: setup, hello world, installation, first app, deployment, autonomy.yaml, docker*
* Create an initial minimal setup and file structure.
* Install and configure the Autonomy Command.
* Create an new app with an agent and a simple streaming chat interface for this agent.
* Deploy this new app to the Autonomy Computer, test it, and see logs.

* See list of available models in the Autonomy Computer from Claude, Llama, DeepSeek, and AWS.
* Select and configure the right model for an agent.

## 📖 Definitions

### Autonomy
Autonomy is a platform to ship autonomous AI products.

It provides:

1. **Autonomy Framework**: The Autonomy Framework is an open-source python framework to develop apps and products that leverage teams of collaborating AI agents to autonomously accomplish goals.
2. **Autonomy Computer**: The Autonomy Computer is a cloud-based runtime to run, connect, and scale apps built using the Autonomy Framework. It provides managed infrastructure to run highly scalable and secure autonomous products.
3. **Autonomy Command**: The Autonomy Command is a command-line program to build apps using the Autonomy Framework and run them on the Autonomy Computer.

### Agents

Agents are intelligent actors that autonomously accomplish goals. Apps, running on the Autonomy Computer, can create millions of parallel collaborating agents in seconds.

Each agent:
- Has a unique identity.
- Uses a large language model to understand, reason, and make autonomous decisions.
- Has memory, so it can retain and recall information over time, to make better autonomous decisions.
- Invokes tools to gather new information and take actions.
- Makes plans that break down complex tasks into small iterative steps.
- Can retrieve knowledge beyond the training data of its language model.
- Collaborates with and can delegate work to other agents.

Autonomy Agents are built using the actor model and have all the properties of actors.

### Models
Agents use large language models to understand, reason, and make autonomous decisions. Apps running on the Autonomy Computer can use a wide variety of managed models.

### Memory
Agents have memory organized by scope ID and conversation ID so they can retain and recall information over time to make better autonomous decisions.

### Tools
Tools are external functions that agents can invoke to take actions and gather more information. These external functions can be written in Python or provided by MCP servers.

**Remember:** We designed this guide specifically for coding agents. Always reference the complete context from these specialized guides rather than trying to recreate patterns from memory. This approach ensures consistency and prevents common deployment issues.
